<h3 id="part-1-introduction-to-thearticle">Part-1: Introduction To The¬†Article</h3>
<p>In this series, we‚Äôll cover the advantages of using JavaScript on development boards. For this purpose, we will use <a href="http://www.espruino.com/">Espruino</a>, which is an awesome open source firmware available for many development boards (they got their own boards too). Using Espruino has many advantages to it, one being that it is an interpreter, hence, it gives you instant feedback so that you can prototype and fix bugs easily. Espruino is a great tool that has many advantages over traditional C based programming on IoT development boards. Espruino is able to do so because it uses JavaScript for this purpose. So, why is JavaScript so advantageous over the traditional method? Let‚Äôs find¬†out.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-javascript-foriot">What is JavaScript for¬†IoT?</h3>
<p>JavaScript is a very lightweight compiled programming language. It was developed as a scripting language for Web development but soon started to expand into other spaces such as back-end development with <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> or introduction of Apache CouchDB and <a href="https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/javascript.html">Adobe Acrobat</a>. JavaScript, popularly called JS, soon emerged as a fast pace developing language, which is prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic language, having support for object-oriented programming, imperative and declarative styles.</p>
<p>Now the language that was just designed for the Web soon emerged everywhere and is still growing. On March 6th 2019, <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js">TensorFlow.js</a> 1.0 was introduced to the large community of JS developers. This was the first time such a large Machine learning library was brought to JavaScript.</p>
<p>The list of what can be achieved with this language goes on and on, but here we‚Äôll concentrate on one aspect of this language that makes it perfect for IoT development.</p>
<h3 id="so-whats-the-benefit-of-using-javascript-foriot">So What&rsquo;s The Benefit Of Using JavaScript for¬†IoT?</h3>
<p>This question can be answered in many ways, some are listed¬†below:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Event-driven model ‚ÜíJavaScript is an event-driven language that we can take advantage of for IoT development. Event loops present in JS allows the developer to respond to events in real time, handling multiple tasks at once without waiting for any other tasks to get completed.</li>
<li>Async ‚ÜíThis allows our code to be non-blocking so that it does not wait for any response from a function or command and continues to run the rest of the¬†code.</li>
<li>Bigger developer circle ‚ÜíJS is a very popular, relatively easy language to learn and to get along with, therefore it has a relatively bigger developer circle allowing more exposure and development for the IoT sector¬†too.</li>
<li>The ability to use Read-Eval-Print-Loop ‚ÜíThis is something very unique that interests me a lot. This means that you can simply interact with the development board using something similar to a CLI and there is no need to compile and upload the code as a whole. This really increases the prototyping speed on small scale projects. We‚Äôll see an advantage of this later in the article when we use <a href="https://www.espruino.com/">Espruino</a> on¬†NodeMCU.</li>
<li>JSON handling- We all know the ability of JavaScript in the world of Web, especially due to JSON. Yes, running JavaScript on the IoT development board also allows the developer to handle and play around with JSON data more¬†easily.</li>
</ul>
<p>These were only a few advantages of using JavaScript as the programming language for development boards, as we go further in this article and articles that follow we‚Äôll continuously see some more advantages of using JavaScript for IoT. So let‚Äôs see what it takes to run JavaScript on a simple low-end development board.</p>
<h3 id="what-will-weneed">What Will We¬†Need?</h3>
<p>We‚Äôll need the following items for this project¬†‚Üí</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07RMHW6QT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">NodeMCU (This is what I‚Äòll be using)</a> ‚Üí <strong>NodeMCU</strong> is an open source IoT development board. It has features like WiFi inbuilt and has many I/O pins and only one analog pin. We are using this board as it‚Äôs cheap and does really good work for its money when compared to other development boards. This board also supports features like ‚ÄúDeep Sleep‚Äù that allows it to save a lot of battery, eg:- if the board requires to take a sensor reading every 5 seconds, it would power up only then, take the reading and go back to¬†sleep.</li>

<h3 id="now-lets-set-up-espruino-on-ournodemcu">Now let‚Äôs Set Up Espruino On Our¬†NodeMCU</h3>
<p>Getting Things Ready¬†‚Üí</p>
<p>The first thing is to properly setup Espruino firmware on the NodeMCU board so that we can go on with the article. For doing this we‚Äôll require a proper Espruino firmware for our NodeMCU development board.</p>
<p>We‚Äôll require a tool called <em>Esptool</em>. This is a python tool that will help us with setting up Espruino. Make sure you have this python tool up and running, you can refer the below link for guidance on how to install and to know more about this tool ‚Üí <a href="https://pypi.org/project/estools/">esptools‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäPyPI</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would recommend that you use <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">python version above 3</a> in place of python version 2 and use ‚Äúpip3 install esptool‚Äù¬†.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After installing the required tool, make sure your board is connected to your PC via USB cable ( I am assuming that you have already installed the USB drivers required for NodeMCU, if not please follow this link ‚Üí <a href="https://medium.com/@cilliemalan/installing-nodemcu-drivers-on-windows-d9bffdbad52">Driver Installation NodeMCU</a> ). To get started run the following command in the terminal of any Linux distro or in the Command Prompt on Windows (make sure esptool is installed already).</p>
<p>*Replace <strong>MySerialPort</strong> with the port your board is connected to.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/media/ee65e8baa7a007ffea8ab34eb9f98d2d/href">https://medium.com/media/ee65e8baa7a007ffea8ab34eb9f98d2d/href</a></p>
<p>On running this you‚Äôll get somewhat similar results as¬†below:-</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/683/1*F2jyBHR74_k5Z03yUtAsbQ.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Make sure you run the command with the right serial port else you‚Äôll get an error (On Windows the serial port will start with¬†‚ÄúCOM‚Äù)</p>
<p>Here all we are looking for is the ‚ÄúDetected flash size‚Äù value. You can clearly see my NodeMCU has an ESP8266 chip containing a 4MB flash¬†size.</p>
<p>Now what we need is all the right resources so that we can use JavaScript on our NodeMCU. For this purpose, I have bundled all the resources that we are going to need into a Github repo (link below). Please either clone or download this resource from the Github¬†page.</p>
<p>‚Üí <a href="https://github.com/sarthakpranesh/Espruino-medium-">Github Espruino-resources</a></p>
<p>After you have downloaded or cloned the files from the link above, the first thing to do is some cleaning on your chip. Yeah, you heard it right, Cleaning. We need to completely remove the older firmware and any other thing stored in the flash memory of our NodeMCU. For doing so we run the following command with <strong>MySerialPort</strong> representing the port your device is connected to.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/media/bc704504b2005447ee0de5d72e5f7f20/href">https://medium.com/media/bc704504b2005447ee0de5d72e5f7f20/href</a></p>
<p>This command should return something similar to¬†below.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/418/0*pyMWRnr0oremIvLL" alt=""></p>
<p>The second last line confirms that the cleaning of our chip‚Äôs memory was a¬†success.</p>
<p>Now we are ready to introduce our board to its new best friend ‚ÄúThe Espruino‚Äù.</p>
<p>Welcome Espruino¬†‚Üí</p>
<p>Now it‚Äôs time we flash the new Espruino firmware to our NodeMCU. Before doing this please find the folder with the name ‚ÄúEspruino-firmware‚Äù inside the downloaded resources and make sure you execute the command below from inside of that folder ( hint:- use the cd command to reach that directory )‚Üí</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/media/1de5c5f9cd7f33d6b409d530f65616f4/href">https://medium.com/media/1de5c5f9cd7f33d6b409d530f65616f4/href</a></p>
<p>Note: Remember to change the <strong>MySerialPort</strong> to the port your device is connected to.</p>
<p>I won‚Äôt be going in depth with this command as it involves things related to interfacing with the hardware, flashing the firmware on it and nothing¬†more.</p>
<p>Now our NodeMCU is ready to utilize the power of¬†JS.</p>
<h3 id="getting-theide">Getting The¬†IDE</h3>
<p>Before we get started let‚Äôs set up our little environment where we can code JS and interact with our¬†NodeMCU.</p>
<p>For doing so we need to add a Google app to our Google Chrome browser. If you don‚Äôt use Google Chrome I‚Äôd like to request you to get it for this purpose. Please add the following app to your browser before you continue.</p>
<p>‚Üí<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/espruino-web-ide/bleoifhkdalbjfbobjackfdifdneehpo">Espruino Web¬†IDE</a></p>
<p>After the IDE opens up you‚Äôll see a window like this¬†‚Üí</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/965/0*PPxlfaFkLUYMMl3-" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="setting-up-theide">Setting Up The¬†IDE</h3>
<p>Now what we want to do is click on the settings icon on the top right-hand side of the IDE window and go to Communications as shown¬†below:-</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1022/1*2eMxdEEuEBFbDllXQk0MrA.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In the Communications menu Change the Baud Rate to 115200. By doing this we tell our IDE what speed/rate it needs to use while it communicates with our¬†NodeMCU.</p>
<p>Now we are all set to run JS on our NodeMCU. So why wait let‚Äôs get¬†started.</p>
<h3 id="connecting-the-board-to-theide">Connecting The Board To The¬†IDE</h3>
<p>Click on the yellow connection icon on leftmost top of the screen and select the port on which the device is connected. As soon as the device gets connected, the IDE should look like below (or something similar).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sxMqpHfxlSEVv5g5ME8TLw.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In case of an error, disconnect the NodeMCU from your PC and reconnect it¬†again.</p>
<p>Most of the development boards have some or the other LED inbuilt. Same is the case with the NodeMCU. For verification, we can turn on the inbuilt led on the NodeMCU¬†board.</p>
<p>Here we write a simple program to turn on the inbuilt led on¬†NodeMCU.</p>
<p>Write the following code in the terminal panel of the¬†IDE:-</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/media/edb5a53741f9ec50b5ca0a7f95823c53/href">https://medium.com/media/edb5a53741f9ec50b5ca0a7f95823c53/href</a></p>
<p>And press Enter. This should return ‚Äúundefined‚Äù in the terminal and the inbuilt led on the board should light up indicating all went¬†well.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/618/0*2UylvyLinXPvo_tW" alt=""></p>
<p>One major advantage of using Espruino here is that it has the ability to take commands directly from the terminal window or REPL. This increases prototyping speed and comes very handy as you don‚Äôt need to compile the whole code and upload it as in the case with¬†Arduino.</p>
<p>Now as we have gained some ground let‚Äôs connect the NodeMCU to our personal¬†hotspot.</p>
<h3 id="connecting-the-board-to-personalhotspot">Connecting The board To Personal¬†HotSpot</h3>
<p>For doing so load in the following code in the script editor window and hit ‚ÄúSend to Espruino‚Äù button.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/media/44b3853678c46bd2d10a64f36f7ed672/href">https://medium.com/media/44b3853678c46bd2d10a64f36f7ed672/href</a></p>
<p>In the code replace ‚ÄúYourSSID‚Äù with the name of your hotspot (eg:- ‚ÄúSarthak‚Äù) and ‚ÄúYourPassWord‚Äù with the password of your hotspot (eg:- ‚Äúqwertyuiop1234‚Äù). Also, make sure that the AP band of your hotspot is set to 2.4 GHz (You can find this in your settings menu under portable¬†hotspot)</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Je8WPZbtFqI2gSeKuMGxzQ.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Hit the Send to Espruino button to send the code to the¬†NodeMCU.</p>
<p>If everything goes well you‚Äôll get the following in the terminal.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9zK25FZy8YIO8A9bmGGBZA.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now let‚Äôs break down the necessary part of the code for a better understanding of what it does¬†‚Üí</p>
<ul>
<li>var wifi = require(‚ÄúWiFi‚Äù) ‚Üí if you are not familiar with JavaScript, then this is the simple way of loading libraries that others have written so that you can utilize them in your¬†code.</li>
<li>wifi.setHostname(‚ÄúnodeMCU-espruino‚Äù) ‚Üí this will set the device name of your NodeMCU as ‚ÄúnodeMCU-espruino‚Äù. This can be anything, you can put your name as¬†well.</li>
<li>wifi.connect(‚ÄúYourSSID‚Äù, {password: ‚ÄúYourPassWord‚Äù}, function(){‚Ä¶}) ‚Üí this function tells our NodeMCU to connect to the wifi which has a name as ‚ÄúYourSSID‚Äù using the password for the wifi as ‚ÄúYourPassWord‚Äù. This function takes in a callback function as the third argument. This callback function gets called after the function is executed.</li>
<li>setTimeout() ‚Üí this function helps us in running some code after a particular interval of¬†time.</li>
<li>wifi.getIP() ‚Üí this function returns the information about our NodeMCU like its IP address and other useful information.</li>
<li>wifi.save() ‚Üí saves the information or credentials of the wifi/hotspot locally on the board itself ( WiFi information persists across hard-resets and power cycles after using this command¬†).</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let us dig deeper into¬†it.</p>
<h3 id="whats-thingspeak">What‚Äôs ThingSpeak?</h3>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SHD5HkFfF9M-VV6WRSDvXA.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here ‚ÄúName‚Äù is the name of your widget that will be added to your channel. This widget will get its information from the ‚ÄúField‚Äù option that is set to Field 1. The interval tells the widget about how frequently it needs to update its value. After making these changes hit ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù and you‚Äôll see your widget added to the channel¬†‚Üí</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MYy4aCAQ5zLEL0kVrsMPTQ.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There is one more widget that is already added to our channel. We‚Äôll use this widget to plot a graph of the falling and rising temperature. The ‚ÄúField‚Äù option of this widget is already set to ‚ÄúField 1‚Äù by default and we don‚Äôt need to change¬†it.</p>
<p>Moving on towards the JavaScript code.</p>
<p>You‚Äôll require the code below to generate artificial data and send it to the ThinkSpeak channel. The below code generates temperature data from 0 to 99 and then again starts from one. Each integer created in this range goes to ThingSpeak as the artificial temperature in each¬†20s.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/media/8e0425214ae950146a43f9d218fda42f/href">https://medium.com/media/8e0425214ae950146a43f9d218fda42f/href</a></p>
<p>The starting 15 lines are for connecting the NodeMCU to the personal hotspot you created. Also, notice that we have included one more library called the ‚Äúhttp‚Äù, this library helps in making web requests, such as a GET request. The following code after that is for generating and sending artificial data to the ThinkSpeak channel. Remember to feed in your WiFi details in this code too. Also, there is one more change that you need to make, that is you need to replace the ‚ÄúYourUpdateFeed‚Äù in line 20 with a URL specific to your¬†account.</p>
<p>To get this URL, go back to your ThingSpeak channel and open the ‚ÄúAPI keys‚Äù page¬†‚Üí</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZazyEbuZJRny6vUUnOgnUw.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After you open up this tab you‚Äôll find Keys that are generated for your channel and are private to you, make sure you don‚Äôt give these keys to anyone else or your channel data may not remain¬†private.</p>
<p>Scroll down and find the API requests section on the page and copy the URL in the ‚ÄúUpdate a channel feed‚Äù section as shown below¬†‚Üí</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rNTBMXWbvLQCX4g1_uXtJg.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Make sure you only copy the URL and not the GET¬†keyword</p>
<p>Now paste the URL as a String in place of the ‚ÄúYourUpdateFeed‚Äù keyword. Your final code should look like below with your own private key in¬†place.</p>
<p>( Also make sure that you remove the 0 from the end of the string URL or the value 0 will be sent to ThinkSpeak in place of our artificial data¬†)</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/630/1*V2pWW--_rPadGeCCMo_h-g.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After everything is set, hit the ‚ÄúSend To Espruino‚Äù button and after a few seconds open your ThinkSpeak ‚ÄúPrivate View‚Äù and you‚Äôll see your artificial data has started to come both in the form of a graph as well as the current value. Also in the Web IDE, you‚Äôll see that the count of data stored in ThinkSpeak is printed each time the data is sent to ThinkSpeak.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KiqPl1arL-Um9DIYz0TL3g.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After you have achieved this we are ready to connect our temperature sensor ‚ÄúThe LM35‚Äù to our¬†NodeMCU.</p>
<h3 id="adding-lm35-to-thehack">Adding LM35 To The¬†Hack</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/0*sRF0t3NFMasCEuxw.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>LM35 is a temperature sensor which can measure temperature in the range of -55¬∞C to 150¬∞C. It is a 3-terminal device that provides an analog voltage proportional to the temperature. Higher the temperature, higher is the output¬†voltage</p>
<p>Take three jumper wires and connect them to the NodeMCU, in the following fashion¬†‚Üí</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/870/1*DArwpMZwFD8xmPSSrbDJuQ.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Source:- <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Interface-LM35-With-NodeMCU/">https://www.instructables.com/id/Interface-LM35-With-NodeMCU/</a></p>
<p>A0 pin on the NodeMCU should be connected to the terminal in the middle, connect any 3v3 pin on the NodeMCU to the leftmost terminal keeping the flat side of the LM35 towards you and the rightmost pin of LM35 should be connected to the ground pin on NodeMCU represented by GND or just G. You can use a breadboard for this purpose or just use female-to-female connectors to connect LM35 directly to the¬†NodeMCU.</p>
<p>After making these connections you have to change the previous code as follows¬†‚Üí</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/media/777abb5609667efee12907a11e085ebf/href">https://medium.com/media/777abb5609667efee12907a11e085ebf/href</a></p>
<p>Notice here we have tweaked the code a bit so that it also prints out the temperature that was sent to the ThinkSpeak channel.</p>
<p>After you have written this code in your IDE we are ready to send temperature data to our ThinkSpeak channel. Click ‚ÄúSend To Espruino‚Äù and make sure you get the temperature data printing on the terminal first. After the data has started coming on the terminal you can go to your ThinkSpeak channel and see the graph of temperature along with the current temperature being showcased.</p>
<h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h3>
<p>The article gave us a brief idea of what can be done by running JavaScript on development boards. But of course this is not all, the possibilities of what can be achieved by running a language like JavaScript on development boards are still being explored and the outcomes are extraordinary.</p>
<p>In our next article ‚ÄúJavaScript loves Internet of things Part-2‚Äù we will explore how we can make our own server, configure our NodeMCU to utilize this server and solve even more interesting problems.</p>
<p>Till Then Stay¬†Tuned!</p>
