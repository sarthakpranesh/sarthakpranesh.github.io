summary: "Revisiting my GoLang basics, covering almost all topics, and documenting them here as a blog series for others to learn GoLang"
---

I recently landed an intern opportunity as a GoLang Developer from my college. Though I have been using GoLang for almost two years now I thought it was a good time to revisit those basics as I will be using it for my first professional role. Here is also a recent [tweet](https://twitter.com/SarthakPranesh/status/1438865934488260611) I made regarding this, feel free to drop your suggestion there.

### Syllabus
Here is what I have in mind for this blog series, I'll try to cover all the basics

- [Feeling Go: Variables, and Types](/blogs/golangbasics/2/)
- Carefully Declare Methods: Pointers and Methods
- Control Your Decisions: Sequences, Loop, and Conditional statements
- World of Interface: Interfaces, Polymorphism, and common Interfaces
- Fun with Func: Functions and Callbacks
- Digging Packages: Exploring standard library - JSON, FMT, and Bcrypt
- Jump Dimensions: Parallelism with Go Routines
- Being Sane: Syncing Go Routines and Common Patterns
- Opening Channels: Different Go Channels and Usage
- Beat! Time to Recover: Contexts and Error Handling
- Cherry Time: Writing Documentation, Testing & Benchmarking, and Coverage analysis

### What I'll Use
I am going to use multiple resources for this blog series, from my personal notes to [GoLang Playground](https://play.golang.org/). Here is what you can expect to be present in all my blogs under this series:

- Will have references to official GoLang documentation
- All blogs will have a GoLang Playground link which will contain examples for the topic
- Tweet about each blog, so that you can help me correct myself if I get something wrong ;>

Looking forward to this series â™¥
